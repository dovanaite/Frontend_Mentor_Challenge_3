## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

Since I am just a beginner, this challenge was quite a thing for me. It took me quite a long time, few attempts and many different approaches to complete it. It is not perfect but I am happy with what I achieved (f.e. I shortened my code from 120 to only 27 lines!). 

I struggled most with figuring out where to put "addeventlisteners" to make paragraphs appears one by one. I have also overwrote CSS two times - after finishing style for mobile application, I found out that I didn't take into consideration some parts that were going to be necessary for desktop design. However, as people say, you learn from your mistakes :) And this challenge was a great example how much you learn and improve by doing and finding your mistakes.
